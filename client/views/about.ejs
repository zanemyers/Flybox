            <p>
                Flybox started as an idea by one of <a href="https://rescueriver.com/" target="_blank">Rescue River</a>'s founders,
                both to help with marketing—so they could know which flies to make, what colors to use,
                and where to promote certain flies—and as a tool for fly-fishing enthusiasts. While some shops post reports online,
                many still record them on a board in their shop, leaving information scattered and hard to track for those who fish.
